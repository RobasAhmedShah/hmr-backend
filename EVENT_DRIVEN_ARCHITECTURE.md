# 🚀 Event-Driven Architecture Implementation

## Overview
This implementation transforms the HMR Backend into a fully event-driven, async, dynamic architecture using `@nestjs/event-emitter`. The system now uses events to decouple services and ensure automatic cross-service updates.

## 🏗️ Architecture Changes

### 1. Event Infrastructure
- **EventEmitterModule** configured globally in `AppModule`
- **Event DTOs** created in `src/events/` directory
- **Event Listeners** implemented in `src/listeners/` directory
- **ListenersModule** integrated with main application

### 2. Event Types Implemented
- `InvestmentCompletedEvent` - When investments are made
- `RewardDistributedEvent` - When rewards are distributed
- `WalletCreditedEvent` - When wallets are credited
- `UserCreatedEvent` - When users are created
- `TransactionRecordedEvent` - When transactions are recorded
- `OrganizationLiquidityUpdatedEvent` - When organization liquidity changes
- `PortfolioUpdatedEvent` - When portfolios are updated

### 3. Event Listeners
- **PortfolioListener** - Updates portfolio totals after investments and rewards
- **OrganizationListener** - Updates organization liquidity after investments
- **TransactionListener** - Logs transaction events (transactions created by main services)
- **AuditListener** - Logs all events for audit trail

## 🔄 Service Refactoring

### InvestmentService
- ✅ Removed direct `PortfolioService` dependency
- ✅ Emits `investment.completed` events
- ✅ Portfolio and organization updates handled by listeners
- ✅ Transaction creation remains in main service

### RewardService
- ✅ Removed direct `PortfolioService` dependency
- ✅ Emits `reward.distributed` events
- ✅ Portfolio updates handled by listeners
- ✅ Parallel async processing for multiple users

### AdminService
- ✅ Emits `user.created` events for audit/logging
- ✅ Auto-creation of wallet, KYC, and portfolio remains transactional

### WalletService
- ✅ Emits `wallet.credited` events for audit/logging
- ✅ Transaction creation remains in main service

## 🎯 Event Flow

### User Creation Flow
1. User created → Wallet, KYC, Portfolio auto-created (transactional)
2. `user.created` event emitted for audit/logging

### Investment Flow
1. Investment created (transactional)
2. `investment.completed` event emitted
3. **PortfolioListener** updates portfolio totals
4. **OrganizationListener** updates organization liquidity
5. **TransactionListener** logs the event

### Reward Distribution Flow
1. Rewards distributed (transactional)
2. `reward.distributed` events emitted for each user
3. **PortfolioListener** updates portfolio rewards
4. **TransactionListener** logs the events

### Wallet Deposit Flow
1. Wallet credited (transactional)
2. `wallet.credited` event emitted
3. **TransactionListener** logs the event

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Hybrid Event Processing
- **Critical updates** (portfolio, organization liquidity) use `transactionManager` when available
- **Audit/logging events** are async after commit
- **Error handling** with try/catch blocks, errors logged but don't fail main operations

### Performance Optimizations
- **Parallel async processing** for reward distribution to multiple users
- **Async event listeners** to prevent blocking main operations
- **Independent transactions** for each listener operation

### Error Handling
- All listeners wrapped in `try/catch`
- Errors logged but don't fail main operations
- Logger service for comprehensive error tracking

## 📊 Benefits Achieved

### 1. Decoupling
- Services no longer have direct dependencies on each other
- Event-driven communication between services
- Easier to maintain and extend

### 2. Performance
- Async event processing prevents blocking
- Parallel processing for multiple operations
- Better resource utilization

### 3. Reliability
- Event listeners are fault-tolerant
- Main operations continue even if events fail
- Comprehensive error logging

### 4. Scalability
- Easy to add new event listeners
- Event-driven architecture supports microservices
- Better separation of concerns

## 🧪 Testing

### API Endpoints for Testing
All existing endpoints remain unchanged:
- `POST /admin/users` - User creation with auto-creation
- `POST /organizations` - Organization creation
- `POST /properties` - Property creation
- `POST /wallet/deposit` - Wallet deposit with events
- `POST /investments/invest` - Investment with events
- `POST /rewards/distribute` - Reward distribution with events
- `GET /portfolio/user/:userId/detailed` - Portfolio details
- `GET /organizations/:id/liquidity` - Organization liquidity
- `GET /transactions/user/:userId` - User transactions

### Event Verification
- Check application console for event emission logs
- Verify data consistency across related entities
- Confirm no duplicate transactions
- Test error handling scenarios

## 🔧 Configuration

### Dependencies Added
- `@nestjs/event-emitter` - Event emission and listening
- All existing dependencies maintained

### Module Structure
